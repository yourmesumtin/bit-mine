# Terraform AWS IAM Module

This Terraform module is designed to create a set of AWS IAM resources including a role, policy, group, and user. These resources are named with a common suffix for easy identification and management.

## Module Components

1. **IAM Role (`prod_role`)**: 
   - A role with no permissions that can be assumed by users within the same AWS account.

2. **IAM Policy (`prod_policy`)**: 
   - A policy allowing entities to assume the role.

3. **IAM Group (`prod_group`)**: 
   - A group with the above policy attached.

4. **IAM User (`prod_user`)**: 
   - A user belonging to the above group.

5. **Group Policy Attachment (`prod_group_policy_attachment`)**:
   - Attaches the policy to the group.

6. **User Group Membership (`prod_user_group_membership`)**:
   - Adds the user to the group.

## Usage

## Initialize and Apply Terraform configuration

After writing your Terraform configuration, the next step is to initialize the Terraform working directory and apply the configuration to create the infrastructure.
